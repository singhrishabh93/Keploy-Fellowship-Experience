Hi, Hello and welcome to my new blog. Today I'll talk about my Keploy Fellowship experience.

First and foremost, I want to thank the Keploy team for selecting me for the Keploy Fellowship Program. The experience was fantastic; I learned a lot and made a lot of new friends.

The first day was an orientation session. I met new people and made incredible connections during that session.

On Day 2, I learned the fundamentals of API, such as how API works and how it aids in data management.

The third day focused on public APIs. We built a Weather web app with a public Weather API. It was so much fun that I made my first app using API.

On Day 4, we developed our own API, Movies-API. This API reads movie data from a JSON file and prints it to the web. We built it with Node and Express JS.

On Day 5, I discovered two new concepts: Docker and Keploy. So far, we've seen how keploy can help us generate test cases and data mocks when we use Postman or other API Testers to call the API. That was a really cool thing to do.

Finally, on Day 6, we created a ninja API using Go Lang, and I believe Go Lang is easier than Node.

So, overall, my experience was fantastic. I learned a lot of new things, such as Keploy, Docker, Go Lang, and so on. Mentors also provided invaluable assistance. I am extremely grateful to Hardik Kumar, Nishant Mishra, and Ankit Kumar for your kind advice.
